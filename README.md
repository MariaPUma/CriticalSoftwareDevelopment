### Critical Software Development  
This repository contains a collection of projects developed for critical software environments. The primary focus is on providing robust and reliable solutions for applications where availability, security, and accuracy are essential.  

### Included Projects  
1. **Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning**  
   Models designed to identify anomalous behaviors in time series data for critical systems. These models leverage machine learning algorithms to:  
   - Monitor systems in real time.  
   - Detect unusual patterns or out-of-the-ordinary events.  
   - Enhance early detection of potential failures.  
   **Models**: LSTM Neural Network, Autoencoder, and Isolation Forest.  

2. **Containers and Deployment with Docker**  
   Configuration and management of containers using Docker to ensure:  
   - Application portability across different environments.  
   - Fast and efficient deployment.  
   - Isolation and consistency in runtime environments.  

3. **Distributed Coordination with ZooKeeper**  
   Implementation of tools for orchestrating and managing distributed systems, including:  
   - Coordination mechanisms between distributed nodes.  
   - Centralized configuration management.  
   - Support for highly available and resilient environments.  

### Objective  
The primary goal of this repository is to provide practical examples for critical software development, addressing common challenges such as fault detection, scalability, and efficient management of distributed environments.
